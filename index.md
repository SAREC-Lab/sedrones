## Software Engineering for UAVs - Teaching Material

This is a hands-on course in which students will engage in a Software Engineering project that involves writing software  to programmatically control unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Software written to control and fly a drone is considered Safety Critical because it is necessary to ensure that the drone (1) complies with federal FAA regulations, (2) does not land on a person or otherwise cause a person harm of any kind, (3) does not crash into drones or other objects during flight, and (4) does not otherwise fly in a way that may cause an accident. The software must therefore be planned, developed, and tested rigorously and the software must be demonstrated as safe for use.   While the course emphasizes UAVs, many of the skills are applicable to other types of Cyber Physical systems i.e., systems in which incorporate, and seamlessly integrate, physical components and computational algorithms.

Students will work with both virtual and physical drones throughout the semester. They will write code that controls the safe flight of multiple drones primarily using DroneKit Python and Mavlink.   While the course focuses primarily on programming and design, students will be exposed to, and immersed, in many aspects of the systems development process including requirements analysis and specification, architectural design, hardware interfaces, coding, testing, and safety assurance.  The first half of the course will focus on coding and Software Engineering skills,  with students engaging in a series of progressively challenging programming exercises culminating in controlling the interactions of multiple drones in simultaneous flight.  In the second half of the course, students will work in teams (of approximately 4 people) to develop a UAV application.   Projects will include formation flying and/or swarming,  immersive UIs (for anyone with graphics and/or gaming experience), or real-world UAV prototype applications in conjunction with the City of South Bend.  Throughout the course we will leverage the Dronology open source framework for various assignments.
