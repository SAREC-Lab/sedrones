## Software Engineering for UAVs - Teaching Material

This is a hands-on course in which students will engage in a Software Engineering project that involves writing software  to programmatically control unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Software written to control and fly a drone is considered Safety Critical because it is necessary to ensure that the drone (1) complies with federal FAA regulations, (2) does not land on a person or otherwise cause a person harm of any kind, (3) does not crash into drones or other objects during flight, and (4) does not otherwise fly in a way that may cause an accident. The software must therefore be planned, developed, and tested rigorously and the software must be demonstrated as safe for use.   While the course emphasizes UAVs, many of the skills are applicable to other types of Cyber Physical systems i.e., systems in which incorporate, and seamlessly integrate, physical components and computational algorithms.
