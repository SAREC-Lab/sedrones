## Overview

During this course we will utilize a UAV simulator as well as physical UAVs. The development and simulation environment is provide
via a Virtual Machine that can be run on either a Mac or a Windows machine.  For use on Linux we provide installation scripts.

Note: After you download and install your VM please do NOT update the environment as this *will* cause conflicts with some of the software
that is needed for integration with Drone software and hardware.  Specifically do not update Python (we currently need 2.7). 

## VM for Windows:

* Install VMWare.  We recommend [VMWare player v15] (https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html)
VMWare tends to have fewer issues for mounting flash drives and telemetry radios.
* Download the SE_with_drones VM from this [link](https://drive.google.com/a/nd.edu/file/d/1VsodGY10lf38QQedbmK6jqIIQ2wQidMM/view?usp=sharing)
* Start up your VMWare installation and import the downloaded VM.

## VM for Mac:
* Install Virtual Box.  
* Download the SE_with_drones VM from this [link](https://drive.google.com/a/nd.edu/file/d/1JMvK_rWuA0fdvAaOUo0eOLSqLNwTOas7/view?usp=sharing)
* Start up your Virtual Box using this VM.

## Linux:
* Installation scripts will be provided upon request.

## Tips for solving installation problems.

We often encounter minor problems when installing on the Mac.  Here are tips for resolving these issues.

* If you have a dual boot computer with Mac and Windows, we strongly recommend installing the VMWare option on Windows.  It leads to a far easier
installation with fewer problems.  In particular we have found that VirtualBox may sometimes run slowly.  
* More coming soon.
