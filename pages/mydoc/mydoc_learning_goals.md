## Learning Objectives

* UAV Development and Calibration: including Python, MavProxy and DroneKit.  Students will programmatically control UAVs.  They will use existing tools to calibrate UAVs and to inspect their logs.
* FAA Regulations: UAVs flying a controlled airspace.  Students will be familiar with governing regulations as well as safety standards.
* Software Engineering techniques: Students will apply appropriate Software and Systems Engineering practices related to safety analysis, requirements engineering, architectural design, and testing to develop a non-trivial, fully functioning UAV application.
* Problem solving: Students will address challenging problems such as developing and evaluating collision avoidance algorithms for multiple UAVs.
* UAV Hardware:  Students will learn to work with UAV related hardware such as RTK, Raspberry Pis onboard, and wifi-in-the-sky.
* Ethics of Drones:  Software systems, especially ones that involve physical computing devices, impact society as a whole.  Through proposing an application with Societal benefits, students will think critically about pertinent issues related to use of drones in society and be able to articulate the major issues involved.  
* Communication and Team skills: Students will work as part of a team to describe their technical designs and solutions verbally and in writing.
