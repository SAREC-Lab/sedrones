## Class Schedule

Please note: If we find a warm day to go flying we will adjust the schedule accordingly. If this happens then lecture notes for that week will
be recorded so that we can retain the homework schedule.  Alternately if there is a warm weekend day there will be an optional flying time before Spring
break -- otherwise flying will commence after Spring break.
