## Project (60 points)
This is primarily a projects based course, and so the majority of points are assigned based on the team project.
Everyone will work with a team of 2-4 people. Teams may be self-organized according to project interests; however
the instructor reserves the right to add additional people to teams to ensure a good fit for every student.  Project
teams will be formed by February 27th.  The following dates represent TURN IN DATES.

A description of weekly project deliverables can be found here: [Weekly Deliverables](https://sarec-lab.github.io/sedrones/pdf/2019-ProjectRequirements.pdf)

Note: Towards the end of the semester everyone will complete an online assessment form
for team member contribution.  Anyone making a sub-standard contribution (which is rare) will receive
a deduction of up to 10 points.  Anyone failing to participate in a specific deliverable without explanation
to the instructor could receive zero points for that deliverable.

## Homework feedback and constraints

All homework must be turned in on time unless you have an excused reason (e.g., illness or a time-consuming job
interview) for a late submission.  Unexecused late assignments will be graded at 50% if turned in within one week.
 All grades and feedback will be committed to a feedback.txt file in your private github repository.  You should receive feedback
within one week of your submission.  If you do not see feedback, and you turned your homework in on time, it is your responsibility
to notify the instructor.

## Plagiarism

All individual assignments are expected to be completed by each student individually. Sections of code related to UAV control
 may be reused from public sources if integrated into individual programs.  Examples of acceptable reuse would be code
 taken from examples provided by 3DR.  All reused code must be clearly attributed.
